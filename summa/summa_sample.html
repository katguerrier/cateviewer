            <p class="objection">
                <strong>Objection 1.</strong>
                It seems that the existence of God is self-evident. Now those things are said to be self-evident to us the knowledge of which is naturally implanted in us, as we can see in regard to first principles. But as <span class="bio">Damascene</span> says <span class="citation">(De Fide Orth. i, 1,3)</span>, "the knowledge of God is naturally implanted in all." Therefore the existence of God is self-evident.
            </p>
            <p class="objection">
                <strong>Objection 2.</strong>
                Further, those things are said to be self-evident which are known as soon as the terms are known, which the <span class="bio">Philosopher</span> <span class="citation">(1 Poster. iii)</span> says is true of the first principles of demonstration. Thus, when the nature of a whole and of a part is known, it is at once recognized that every whole is greater than its part. But as soon as the signification of the word "God" is understood, it is at once seen that God exists. For by this word is signified that thing than which nothing greater can be conceived. But that which exists actually and mentally is greater than that which exists only mentally. Therefore, since as soon as the word "God" is understood it exists mentally, it also follows that it exists actually. Therefore the proposition "God exists" is self-evident.
            </p>
            <p class="objection">
                <strong>Objection 3.</strong>
                Further, the existence of truth is self-evident. For whoever denies the existence of truth grants that truth does not exist: and, if truth does not exist, then the proposition "Truth does not exist" is true: and if there is anything true, there must be truth. But God is truth itself: "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<span class="bible">John 14:6</span>) Therefore "God exists" is self-evident.
            </p>
            <p class="sedcontra">
                <strong>On the contrary,</strong>
                No one can mentally admit the opposite of what is self-evident; as the <span class="bio">Philosopher</span> <span class="citation">(Metaph. iv, lect. vi)</span>s states concerning the first principles of demonstration. But the opposite of the proposition "God is" can be mentally admitted: "The fool said in his heart, There is no God" <span class="bible">(Psalm 53:2)</span>. Therefore, that God exists is not self-evident.
            </p>
            <p class="response">
                <strong>I answer that:</strong>
                A thing can be self-evident in either of two ways: on the one hand, self-evident in itself, though not to us; on the other, self-evident in itself, and to us. A proposition is self-evident because the predicate is included in the essence of the subject, as "Man is an animal," for animal is contained in the essence of man. If, therefore the essence of the predicate and subject be known to all, the proposition will be self-evident to all; as is clear with regard to the first principles of demonstration, the terms of which are common things that no one is ignorant of, such as being and non-being, whole and part, and such like. If, however, there are some to whom the essence of the predicate and subject is unknown, the proposition will be self-evident in itself, but not to those who do not know the meaning of the predicate and subject of the proposition. Therefore, it happens, as Boethius says (Hebdom., the title of which is: "Whether all that is, is good"), "that there are some mental concepts self-evident only to the learned, as that incorporeal substances are not in space." Therefore I say that this proposition, "God exists," of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject, because God is His own existence as will be hereafter shown (I:3:4). Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature â€” namely, by effects.

                <strong>Reply to Objection 1:</strong>
                To know that God exists in a general and confused way is implanted in us by nature, inasmuch as God is man's beatitude. For man naturally desires happiness, and what is naturally desired by man must be naturally known to him. This, however, is not to know absolutely that God exists; just as to know that someone is approaching is not the same as to know that Peter is approaching, even though it is Peter who is approaching; for many there are who imagine that man's perfect good which is happiness, consists in riches, and others in pleasures, and others in something else.

                <strong>Reply to Objection 2:</strong>
                Perhaps not everyone who hears this word "God" understands it to signify something than which nothing greater can be thought, seeing that some have believed God to be a body. Yet, granted that everyone understands that by this word "God" is signified something than which nothing greater can be thought, nevertheless, it does not therefore follow that he understands that what the word signifies exists actually, but only that it exists mentally. Nor can it be argued that it actually exists, unless it be admitted that there actually exists something than which nothing greater can be thought; and this precisely is not admitted by those who hold that God does not exist.

                The existence of truth in general is self-evident but the existence of a Primal Truth is not self-evident to us.
