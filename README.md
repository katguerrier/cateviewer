## A way to view Church documents that doesn't suck ##

### Premise ###
The Catholic Church is the custodian of a tradition handed down by the Apostles over the course of two millennia of tradition. Out of her have come documents and treatises that are wellsprings of intellectual and devotional thought of immense value to the human race.

And sometimes it really, really sucks to read them. 

This project aims to set important Catholic documents in a way that is accessible to the modern reader, especially the neurodiverse. Use of modern typographic conventions combined with the dynamic organizational / navigational abilities afforded by HTML can be leveraged to make these documents easier to read, greatly extending their reach.
